  <h1>I would like to build</h1>
  <p>
    <!-- write your app ideas here ðŸ‘‡ -->
    One of the apps I would like to build is one that a group of friends could use to track the co-op games they want to play together.
    The primary features would be: 1) A queue of games that everyone can see. 2) A voting system to choose what game to play next. 3) Integration into the Steam API to show time played on each game.
